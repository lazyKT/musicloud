The frontend Side of the MusiCloud WebApp (Music Sharing Platform).

Developing with ReactJs. 
Backend API is written with Python Flask.

#### What's it, musicloud?###
```
The users can convert any Youtube Video Link or Facebook Video Link to mp3 audio files 
and can save as song libraries in the server.
Later users can have their own playlists (song libraries) and can access to them at anytime, anywhere.
```

Feel free to check the codes and I would be much appreciated if you could review the codes.
Thank You. :D
